<p> This dataset contains the prices of gemstones {Diamonds} (Regression Analysis). The dataset contains 10 independent variables (including <b> id </b>):

1. **`id`** :  unique identifier of each diamond
2. **`carat weight`**: Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
3. **`cut`**: The quality of the cut of the gemstones/diamonds.
4. **`color`**: The color of the gemstones/diamonds.
5. **`clarity`**: Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
6. **`depth`**: The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface).
7. **`table`**: A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
8. **`X`**: The length of the gemstones/diamonds. X is the length of the diamond as measured along the girdle.
9. **`Y`**: The width of the gemstones/diamonds. Y is the width of the diamond as measured along the girdle.
10. **`Z`**: The symmetry of the gemstones/diamonds. Z is the height of the diamond from the culet to the table.

<div style="color: White; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; font-size: 25px;">
  Target variable:
</div>

**`Price`**: Price of the given Diamond.

The goal of this project is to predict the price of a gemstone based on independent variables.
